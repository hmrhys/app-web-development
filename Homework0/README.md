# Homework 0: Thoughts on Ungrading

## 1. What are your thoughts on the Ungrading practice as it applies in general to teaching and learning (not necessarily specifically to this class)?

I think that the concept of ungrading is very interesting. While I have never done anything like it before, I am very interested in trying it. I think that it will relieve a lot of the pressure that grades bring, and ultimately create an environment that puts primary focus on truly learning and understanding concepts instead of just trying to get the best grade that you can.

## 2. What are your thoughts on the way Ungrading will be applied to this class based on what has been explained by your instructor and what is described in the syllabus?

I like the idea of creating a portfolio of work over the course of the semester and getting feedback on the assignments that not only say what you're missing but tell you what to improve on and and how to do it. As said in the first question, I think that this system will ultimately foster an environment of learning and wanting to improve for solely yourself rather than for a grade. I'm looking forward to seeing how it works this semester.

## 3. On the scale from 1 to 5, how confident are you in that you can earn an A in this class (1 is lowest, 5 is highest)?

3 or 4
