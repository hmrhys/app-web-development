# Final Grade Proposal Worksheet Instructions

**The final grade proposal is due Wednesday, May 1st, before 2:30pm**.

---

The first step in proposing your final grade for the class will be to completely fill out the Final Grade Proposal Worksheet following the template provided below. This worksheet will be used to help you reflect on your work throughout the semester and to help you make a case for the grade you believe you have earned. The contents of your worksheet will become part of what the teaching staff will review when considering your final grade proposal.

## Part 1: Preliminaries

1. Create a new Markdown file in your individual repository named `FinalGradeProposalWorksheet.md`. Populate this file with the contents of the Final Grade Proposal Worksheet Template provided below.
2. Update the placeholders in the heading of the worksheet with your full name and Unity ID.

## Part 2: Individual Homework Assignments

For each individual assignment you completed this semester, fill out the corresponding table with a row for each submission you made where the first row is the first submission, the second row is the first rework, and so on. For each submission, include the date you submitted the assignment, how you self-rated the quality of the submission, a summary of the feedback you received, and a summary of the changes you made based on the feedback.

## Part 3: Individual Contributions to the Team Project

1. Update the link to your team project repository in the worksheet.
2. Fill out the table where for each milestone you will indicate your individual contributions, the percentage that your contribution signifies for the completion of the milestone, your team's self-rating, and a summary of the feedback you received.

## Part 4: Peer Evaluations for the Team Project

1. Replace placeholders in the table with the names of your team members.
2. Fill out the table with your peer evaluations for each of your team members based on the criteria provided.
